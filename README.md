# A Pixel-Based Approach for Aerial Image Segmentation of Sentinel-2 Imagery



This project implements and compares three machine learning approaches for land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, focusing on urban areas in central Hanoi, Vietnam.



## üéØ Project Overview



The rapid urbanization of Hanoi poses significant challenges for land use management and urban planning. This study addresses these challenges by developing automated land cover classification systems that can:



- Monitor urban growth and land use changes

- Support intelligent land management systems

- Provide geospatial data for urban planning authorities

- Detect unauthorized land conversions

**Additional Feature**: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)

```

NDVI = (B8 - B4) / (B8 + B4)

```



## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements



### Python Libraries

```

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

gdal

rasterio

pandas

tensorflow

keras

```



### Software

- **QGIS** (for data preprocessing and ground truth creation)

- **Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP)** (for ROI digitization)

- **Python 3.x** (for model implementation)



## üöÄ Getting Started



### 1. Data Preparation

1. Download Sentinel-2 Level 2A imagery from Copernicus Open Access Hub

2. Extract and preprocess spectral bands in QGIS

3. Calculate NDVI using the raster calculator

4. Create training data using SCP plugin



### 2. Model Training



#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

```python

from sklearn.svm import SVC

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV



# Parameter tuning

param_grid = {

&nbsp;   'C': [2**i for i in range(-2, 8)],

&nbsp;   'gamma': [2**i for i in range(-5, 5)]

}



svm = SVC(kernel='rbf')

svm_grid = GridSearchCV(svm, param_grid, cv=5)

```



#### Random Forest

```python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier



# Parameter tuning

rf = RandomForestClassifier(

&nbsp;   n_estimators=[100, 200, 500],

&nbsp;   max_features=range(1, 11)

)

```



#### 1D CNN Architecture

```python

import tensorflow as tf

from tensorflow.keras import layers



model = tf.keras.Sequential([

&nbsp;   layers.Conv1D(64, 2, activation='relu', input_shape=(7, 1)),

&nbsp;   layers.BatchNormalization(),

&nbsp;   layers.Dropout(0.3),

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   layers.Conv1D(32, 2, activation='relu'),

&nbsp;   layers.BatchNormalization(),

&nbsp;   layers.Dropout(0.3),

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   layers.Conv1D(16, 2, activation='relu'),

&nbsp;   layers.BatchNormalization(),

&nbsp;   layers.Dropout(0.3),

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   layers.Flatten(),

&nbsp;   layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),

&nbsp;   layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),

&nbsp;   layers.Dense(4, activation='softmax')  # 4 classes

])

```



### 3. Dataset Split

- **Total labeled pixels**: 18,681

- **Training set**: 14,944 pixels (80%)

- **Testing set**: 3,737 pixels (20%)



## üìà Model Performance



### Class-wise F1-Scores



| Class | SVM | Random Forest | 1D CNN |

|-------|-----|---------------|---------|

| Water | 0.99 | 0.98 | **0.99** |

| Built Area | 0.94 | 0.95 | **0.98** |

| Vegetation | 0.59 | 0.63 | **0.77** |

| Others | 0.76 | 0.75 | **0.88** |



### Key Findings



1. **CNN Superior Performance**: The 1D CNN model achieved the highest accuracy (95.26%) by effectively learning spectral patterns

2. **Class Confusion**: Most errors occurred between vegetation and bare land/construction sites due to spectral similarity

3. **NDVI Importance**: Adding NDVI significantly improved vegetation vs. others classification

4. **Urban Complexity**: Traditional ML methods (SVM, RF) struggled with spectrally mixed urban land covers
